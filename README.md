NexID Digital Product Passport for Hardware and Tools
NexID is an early-stage side project I'm leading, dedicated to developing innovative solutions for digital product passports. The mission is to provide advanced tracking and management systems to enhance transparency and sustainability in various industries, starting with hardware and tools.

Inspired by my previous work on the Eslando Digital Product Passport (see here), I've embarked on this new venture under the name NexID, focusing on developing a Digital Product Passport tailored specifically for hardware and tools. 

Current Stage:
Currently in the exploration phase, the goal is to assess the feasibility and potential impact of such a solution. Initial testing and research are underway to determine user needs, technical requirements, and potential challenges.

Future Goals:
Conduct thorough market research and user testing to validate the concept and gather feedback.
Define project scope, objectives, and technical requirements based on research findings.
Develop a prototype or minimum viable product (MVP) to test with potential users and stakeholders.
Iterate on the product based on feedback and continue to refine and enhance its features.
